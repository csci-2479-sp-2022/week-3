## Local setup
1. open an Ubuntu terminal
   1. make sure you're in your home directory, where you've hopefully already created a projects folder: `cd ~/projects`
   2. make sure you have docker desktop running
2. clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:csci-2479-sp-2022/week-3.git`
3. go into the project: `cd week-3`
4. copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`
5. run the following docker command to install our Sail dependencies:
```
docker run --rm \
    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v $(pwd):/var/www/html \
    -w /var/www/html \
    laravelsail/php81-composer:latest \
    composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
```
6. Generate an app key for your `.env` file: `sail artisan key:generate`
7. start up the app: `./vendor/bin/sail up -d`
